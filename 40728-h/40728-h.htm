<p><span class="smcap">Juan Diaz</span>, chaplain to Juan de Grijalva. "Itinerario de l' Armata
del Re Catholico in India verso la Isola de Iuchathan del anno M. D.
XVIII."&mdash;Printed first (in the Italian language) as an appendix to the
"Itinerario de Ludovico Varthema," in the edition of 1520, and subsequently
in the editions of 1522, 1526 and 1535 of the latter book. It was
also translated into the English language by Richard Eden, in the "Historie
of Travayles," London, 1577, but I am not sure whether the report
of Diaz is contained in it. The most popular translation is that
by H. Ternaux-Compans, in his first "Recueil de pièces relatives à
la conquéte du Méxique," (Vol. X. of his "Voyages, Relations et Mémoires
originaux pour servir à l' histoire de la découverte de l' Amérique,")
and the latest and best reprint, together with a splendid Spanish
translation, is contained in Vol. I. of "Coleccion de Documentos para la
Historia de México," 1858, by S<sup>r</sup> J. G. Icazbalceta, of México.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petrus Martyr ab Angleria.</span> "Enchiridion de insulis nuper repertis
simulatque incolarum moribus," Basel, 1521. (Separate print of the
4th Decade, which contains the first items about Yucatan ever published
in Europe after Diaz's report).</p>

<p>"De orbe novo decades Petri Martyris ab Angleria, Mediolaneusis,
protonotarii, Cesarei senatoris.&mdash;Compluti apud Michaelem de Eguia,"
in December, 1530. Alcalá.</p>

<p>"Opus Epistolarum Petri Martyris Anglerii, Mediolanensis, &amp;c., &amp;c."
Also printed by Miguel de Eguia. Alcalá.</p>

<p>Of further reprints, and of translations of Peter Martyr's works (the
reports on Yucatan are contained in the 4th and 5th Decades), I merely
quote: "Novus orbis regionum ac insularum veteribus incognitarum,
&amp;c." by Simon Grynæus, Basel, 1532, embodying Dec's 1, 2, 3, <i>and</i> 4.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>(Also the edition of 1536.)&mdash;A French translation of the 4th Decade, by
Simon de Colines, Paris, 1532.&mdash;A German version, by Hôniger of
Kônigshofen.&mdash;Hackluyt's reprint of 1587. "De orbe novo Petri Martyris
Anglerii, &amp;c., &amp;c.," and finally the complete English translation by
Michael Lok and Richard Eden: "De novo Orbe, or the Historie of the
West Indies, &amp;c., &amp;c.," London, 1612. I need not dwell on the great
importance of Martyr's book, for Yucatan.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hernan Cortés.</span> (His first letter is lost: in place of it the letter of
the "Municipality of Vera Cruz," dated 10th July, 1519, contains a short
statement about Yucatan. This letter is printed in Vol. I. of "Coleccion
de Documentos inéditos para la historia de España," and in Vol. I. of
"Historiadores primitivos de Indias," by Enrique de Vedia, Madrid,
1852.&mdash;Folsom's translation of 1843. "Despatches of Hernan Cortés,
the conqueror of Mexico, &amp;c." substitutes an Introduction by the translator
himself.&mdash;The earliest mention of this report is found in Robertson:
"History of America," Vol. III., p. 289, Edition of 1800, and an
abstract is found in Prescott: "Conquest of Mexico," Appendix II., 3d
Vol.) "Fifth letter to the Emperor Charles VII.," noticed by Robertson
and Prescott; contained, in full, in "Historiadores primitivos de Indias,"
Vol. I., by Vedia. A full English translation, by Pascual de Gayangos,
was published in 1868, by the "Hackluyt Society," vol. 40.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juan Cristóbal Calvet de Estrella.</span> "De Rebus Gestis Ferdinandii
Cortèsii," written between 1548 and 1560, and printed with a Spanish
translation: "Vida de Cortés," by Sr. Icazbalceta in Vol. I. of
"Col. de Documentos para la Hist. de México."&mdash;Short and meagre.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrés de Tapia.</span> "Relacion hecha por el Señor Andrés de Tapia,
sobre la conquista de México." (Icazbalceta's "Coleccion de Documentos,
&amp;c." Vol. II. México, 1866.)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benedetto Bordone.</span> "Libro di Benedetto Bordone.&mdash;Nel qual si
ragione tutte l'Isole del mondo con li loro nomi antichi e moderni,"
1528.&mdash;Later editions also.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girolamo Benzoni.</span> "Historia del Mondo Nuovo," Venice, 1565.&mdash;Translated
into German by Nicolaus Hoeniger: "Die Neue Welt und
Indianischen Kônigreichs, neue und wahrhaffte geschichte, &amp;c., &amp;c.,'
Basel, 1579.&mdash;Incorporated in Théodore De Bry "Grosse Reisen,"
Parts 4, 5, and 6.&mdash;Of other prints I but mention the latest English translation,
published by the Hackluyt Society in 1857 (Vol. 21,) under the title
of "History of the New World, by Girolamo Benzoni," edited as well as
translated by Rear-Admiral W. H. Smyth. There are Italian versions of
1572, French of 1587, and Latin of 1600.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bernal Diez del Castillo.</span> "Historia verdadera de la Conquista de
Nueva España," Madrid, 1632. (There may be two editions of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
year). Of the Spanish reprints I mention here (also contained in
"Historiadores primitivos de Indias," Vedia, 1852, Vol. II.), the one
of 1837, Paris, 4 Vols. 12<sup>o</sup>, and the other of 1854, México, 4 vols. also.&mdash;Two
English translations are known to me at present: "The True
History of the Conquest of Mexico, by Captain Bernal Diez del Castillo,"
translated by Maurice Keatings, London, 1800.&mdash;"The Memoirs
of the Conquistador, Bernal Diez del Castillo," translated by John Ingram
Lockhart, London, 1844.&mdash;There is also a German translation, by
P. J. Rehfuss, Bonn, 1838.&mdash;Bernal Diez (not Diaz) is very valuable as
eye-witness, having been to Yucatan with Cordoba (1517), Grijalva
(1518), Cortés (1519),&mdash;and finally with the latter to Honduras, passing
through Peten.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fray Lorenzo de Bienvida.</span> Letter to the Infanto Philip (II.),
dated Yucatan, 10 February, 1548. Original in MS. French translation
by H. Ternaux-Compans in "1<sup>er</sup> Recueil de Piéces concernant le
Méxique," Vol. X. 1838, of his collection of "Mémoires et documents
Originaux, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés.</span> "Historia General y
natural de las Indias," composed of 50 books.&mdash;The first 19 books, and
part of the 50th, were published by the author as early as 1535,&mdash;and
the first 20 books as early as 1557,&mdash;but the entire work has only been
printed in 1851, at Madrid, 4 Vols. folio.&mdash;It is full of details concerning
Yucatan.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francisco Lopez de Gomara.</span> "Historia general de las Indias, y todo
lo acaescido en ellas dende que se ganaron hasta agora. Y la conquista
de México, y de la nueva España, &amp;c." Zaragoza, 1552.&mdash;Of this book I
quote&mdash;e. g.&mdash;the following Spanish editions: Medina del Campo, 1553,
Antwerp, 2 prints, 1554&mdash;Zaragoza, 1555,&mdash;and it is also contained in
"Historiadores primitivos de Indias," by Andrés Gonzalez Barcia, Madrid,
1749, Vol. II.&mdash;and in "Historiadores primitivos de Indias," by
Vedia, Madrid, 1852, Vol. I.&mdash;There is an Italian version, by Augustino
de Cravaliz, Rome, 1556, ("La Histoirie generale delle Indie Occidentali.
&amp;c., &amp;c."), and French translations published respectively in 1578,
1587, 1597, and 1605.&mdash;Finally, Juan Bautista de San Anton Muñoz
Chimalpain Guauhtlehuanitzin made a translation into the Mexican, or
"Nahuatl" language, which C. M. Bustamante published at Mexico,
in 1826.&mdash;I know of no English translation of the work.&mdash;It actually
consists of two parts, the "Historia General," and the "Conquista de
México."&mdash;The former contains a short, but fair, description of Yucatan,
and the latter a report on Cortés' doings there and matters relating
thereto.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bartolomé de las Casas.</span> Of the numerous (over forty) writings of
the Bishop of Chiapas, I select only "Historia de las Indias," published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
"at last," Madrid, 1875 and 1876, by the Marquis de la Fuensanta del
Valle and Don José Sancho Rayon, in 5 vols. The 5th Vol. contains
the famous "Apologética Historia."&mdash;Another publication of the "Historia
de las Indias," though not as complete, has appeared in Mexico in
2 vols., as the first series of Sr. J. M. Vigel's "Biblioteca Mexicana,"
1877 and 1878.&mdash;It does not contain the "Apologética."&mdash;Fragments of the
latter are found in Lord Kingsborough's "Antiquities of Mexico," Vol.
VIII.</p>

<p>"Brevissima relacion de la destruycion de las Indias," Sevilla, 1552.
Of this polemic and strongly tinged memoir there are innumerable versions.&mdash;I
know of Spanish publications besides the above, and those of
London, 1812,&mdash;Philadelphia, 1821,&mdash;both due to Dr. De Mier,&mdash;Madrid,
J. A. Llorente, 1822, and México, 1822.&mdash;Latin translations: Francfort,
1598; Oppenheim, 1614; Heidelberg, 1664.&mdash;French translations: Antwerp,
1579; Amsterdam, 1620; Rouen, 1630; Lyon, 1642; Paris, 1697;
Amsterdam, 1698. (The last two contain each five papers of Las
Casas), and Paris, 1822. "Oeuvres de Don Bartolomé de las Casas,"
by J. A. Llorente.&mdash;Of Italian Translations (with Spanish text). I allude
to those of 1626. Venice.&mdash;1630, Id.:&mdash;1643, Id., and also of 1645.&mdash;There
is a German translation of 1599.&mdash;Dutch translations: Amsterdam,
1610 and 1621, and 1663.&mdash;I know of but one English translation,
which bears the title "A Relation of the first voyages and discoveries
made by the Spaniards in America, &amp;c., &amp;c." London, 1699,&mdash;although
Dr. Robertson mentions one of 1693.&mdash;Las Casas must be used with
great caution.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diego de Landa.</span> "Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan."</p>

<p>Bishop Landa was born in 1524, and died in 1579; his work must
therefore have been written between 1549 and the latter date. It was
published by the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, in 1860, with a French
translation opposite to the Spanish text, and under the title of "Relation
des choses de Yucatan."&mdash;Republished again in 1864, with some
other matter.</p>

<p>The merits of Landa are certainly very great, but the real import of
his so-called "A. B. C." ("De sus letras forme aqui un a. b. c." pp. 316-319),
has been misunderstood and correspondingly misrepresented. The
picture which Landa gives us of the customs and organization of the
Mayas is completely at variance with some of his other statements.
Much close attention is required.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Cartas de Indias.</span>" Vol. I. Madrid, 1878.</p>

<p>These contain several letters and reports on Yucatan, from the 16th
century. I only refer to one, a complaint of four Indian "gobernadores,"
dated 12 April, 1567, against the Bishop Diego de Landa, designating
him as "principal author of all these evils and troubles...."</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph de Acosta.</span> "Historia natural y moral de Indias," Sevilla,
1590. I merely mention this author, without entering into further bibliographical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
details about his work. It has been translated into many
languages, and&mdash;in part or wholly&mdash;incorporated in many general collections
of "Americana." He says but little about Yucatan, still his book
is indispensable to any one studying Yucatecan antiquities. I also
advert here to his former publication, which is but little known: "De
promulgatione Evangelii apud Barbaros, sive de procuranda Indorum
salute," Libros 6; printed in 1589.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerónimo de Mendieta.</span> "Historia ecclesiástica Indiana," written
about 1590, but printed for the first time, by Sr. J. G. Icazbalceta, at
Mexico, in 1870&mdash;Contains much and valuable information.&mdash;Mendieta
has been extensively copied by Torquemada.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fray Toribio de Paredes, Surnamed "Motolinia."</span> "Historia de
los Indios de Nueva-España," written about 1540, but published in full
only by Sr. Icazbalceta in Vol. I. of "Coleccion de Documentos, &amp;c."&mdash;Mentions
Yucatan incidentally.&mdash;A large part of the work had been
printed before in the "Documentos inéditos, &amp;c." under the title of
"Ritos Antiguos, Sacrificios é Idolatrias de las Indias de la Nueva-España,"&mdash;also
in Vol. IX. of Lord Kingsborough.&mdash;A Latin version,
under the title of "De Moribus Indorum" may have existed once.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Yucatan is, furthermore, mentioned in many works of a more general
character, embodying information gathered mostly from the sources
already referred to. I do not, therefore, enter into any lengthy bibliographical
sketches of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon Grynaeus.</span> "Novus Orbis," 1532. Already noticed under
Petrus Martyr.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Petrus Apianus.</span> "Cosmographia," 1539, 1545, 1561 (Dutch version),
&amp;c.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Abraham Ortelius.</span> "Theatrum orbis terrarum," 1571, 1588, &amp;c.
</p><p>

nommé Amérique, et de plusieurs Terres et Isles decouvertes de
notre temps."&mdash;Paris, 1558; Antwerp, 1558; in Italian, at Venice, 1561.
</p><p>
I forbear further mention of the polemic works on the origin of the
American Indians,&mdash;and now turn to some writers whose works are
probably lost, or at least not accessible, although there is positive evidence
of their former existence.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Fray Gerónimo Roman.</span> "Republica Indiana"&mdash;certainly existed as
late as 1630, or "República de las Indias Occidentales."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Fray Alonzo Solana.</span> "Noticias Sagradas y profanas de las Antigüedades
y Conversion de los Indios de Yucatan." (Written before
1600).
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Don Francisco Montejo.</span> "Carta al Rey sobre la fundacion de la
Villa de San Francisco de Campeche, y de la Ciudad de Mérida," 14
June, 1543. (Still at Sevilla, leg. 7. "Cartas de Indias").
</p><p>
In the above list I have not included any Grammar, Vocabulary,
Sermonary, "Doctrina," &amp;c., &amp;c., for the use of the Indians of Yucatan,
or written in the Maya language, of which several are known. In conclusion,
I beg to add the Maya writing, entitled:
</p><p>
"<span class="smcap">Series of Katunes</span>," published, with an English translation, by Mr.
J. L. Stephens, in "Incidents of travels in Yucatan," and by Brasseur
de Bourbourg, in "Rel. d. ch. de Y."</p>


<p class="center p2"><i>Writers of the Seventeenth Century.</i></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Antonio de Herrera.</span> "Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos
en las Islas y la Tierra firme del mar Océano," Madrid, 1601,
1615, 4 vols. folio. There are two other editions in the original language:
Madrid, 1726 and 1730, and Antwerp, 1728.
</p><p>
Of this most important book, several translations have appeared, embodying
either the whole or only a part.&mdash;Thus a French translation of
the "Descripcion de las Indias Occidentales," appeared at Amsterdam
in 1622 twice, and a French translation of the 1st, 2d and 3d Decades, at
Paris, 1671.&mdash;A Latin version of the "Descripcion" was also published in
1622, by Colin, at Amsterdam, and a very unreliable English rendering
by John Stephens, in 6 vols. 8<sup>o</sup>, appeared at London in 1725. Herrera
is one of the most important authorities on every subject of which he
treats.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Gregorio Garcia.</span> "Orígen de los Indios del Nuevo Mundo é Indias
Occidentales." 1st Edition, 1606; Second Edition, Madrid, 1729, by
Barcia.&mdash;A very important and valuable work.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Juan de Torquemada.</span> "Los veinte y uno Libros Rituales y monarchia
Indiana, con el orígen y guerras de los Indios occidentales." 1st

<p>
<span class="smcap">Augustin de Vetancourt.</span> "Teatro Mexicano." México, 1698.&mdash;2d
Edition, in "Biblioteca de la Iberia," México, 1870.&mdash;Treats of Yucatan
incidentally, speaking of Cortés, &amp;c.
</p><p>
The work consists properly of three books: the "Teatro," the "Crónica
de la provincia del Santo Evangelio de México," and the "Menologio
franciscano."
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Antonio de Remesal.</span> "Historia general de las Indias Occidentales,
y particular de la gobernacion de Chiapas y Guatemala."&mdash;This book has

also another title: "Historia de la Provincia de San Vicente de Chyapa
y Guatemala de la Orden de San Domingo."&mdash;Madrid, 1619 and 1620.&mdash;Treats
of Yucatan also, following Las Casas generally. An important
work.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Bernardo Lizana.</span> (Lizama or Lizaba?) "Devocionario de Nuestra
Señora de Itzmal, Historia de Yucatan é de conquista Espiritual," 1663,
according to the Abbé Brasseur and Leon y Pinelo.&mdash;E. G. Squier
speaks of two works: one "Historia de la Provincia de Yucatan, y su
conquista Espiritual," Valladolid, 1633, and the other "Historia de
Nuestra Señora de Izamal."&mdash;Whichever way may be right, there remains
accessible as yet, but a fragment published in Spanish, with a French
translation by the Abbé Brasseur in his "Relation des choses de Yucatan,"
1864. The fragment is entitled: "Del principio y Fundacion destos
cuyos omules deste Sitio y Pueblo de Ytzmal...."&mdash;Lizana
is of the highest importance and value, and it is much to be regretted
that the <i>entire</i> book is of such difficult access.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Diego Lopez de Cogolludo.</span> "Historia de Yucatan."&mdash;1st Edition,
Madrid, 1688; 2d Edition, Mérida, 1842; 3d Edition, 1867.&mdash;Cogolludo
has always been regarded as the historian of Yucatan "par excellence."
He is indeed indispensable for any study of Yucatan antiquities, but,
like all other authors, he must never be implicitly followed. The closest
criticism possible is absolutely required.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gil Gonzalez Dávila.</span> "Teatro ecclesiástico de la primitiva Iglesia

de las Indias Occidentales." Madrid, 1654.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>These constitute the most important sources on Yucatan written during
the 17th century. Nearly all of them are of <i>special</i> value, and we
would call particular attention to Cogolludo, Lizana, Torquemada, Herrera,
and Remesal. Among such authors, who wrote upon the subject
and whose writings are not now accessible, I name here:
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Pedro Sanchez Aguilar.</span> "Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan, y Informe
contra los Idólatras del Obispado de Yucatan, &amp;c." 1639.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Francisco Cárdenas.</span> "Relacion de la Conquista y Succesos de
Yucatan," 1639. (If existing, probably in Spain).
</p><p>

de Itzá y Lacandon, con unas Noticias y Mapa de dichas Tierras."
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Nicolás de Valenzuela.</span> An account of the expedition against the
Lacandones, written 1695, and comprising 402 pages.
</p><p>
I would further call attention to the land titles, such as Deeds,
Grants, donations, &amp;c., &amp;c., in Yucatan, some of which go back to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
17th century. These contain occasional references to the Indian settlements,
some of which are certainly of great value and importance.
</p><p>
Finally, I refer to some general works, treating of Yucatan:
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Samuel Purchas.</span> "His Pilgrimage, &amp;c., &amp;c." London, 1613, 1614
and 1617. (This forms the 5th volume of Purchas' great works).&mdash;The
great work of Purchas, also known as "Hackluytus Posthumous," appeared
in 1625, and treats also of Yucatan.

published in the 18th century, and which contain notices of Yucatan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
would be a task exceeding far the time and limits of this list. It can
easily be proved, however, that the works on especially Yucatecan
topics are not numerous. This may be due, in part, to the rigorous exclusion
of foreigners from Spanish America, and the consequent decline
of intellectual activity towards the close of Spanish domination. The
great collection of Juan Bautista Muñoz contains hardly anything on
Yucatan.</p>


<p class="center p2"><i>Writers of the Nineteenth Century.</i></p>

<p>Here the number of publications increases so rapidly, that I cannot
attempt to notice all. Besides, many of the authors are so well known
that a mere mention of their names and the titles of their works will suffice.

generally, but detailed reference to special articles can be given only

in Mexico and Central America, as far as extent of travel and long
duration of stay are concerned. He knew those countries better, and
had easier access to the natives, than any other similar traveller of this

century. His works are therefore, actual mines of wealth so far as old
documents are concerned: he has collected and brought to light more
manuscripts than any other student. But his honest zeal and unrestrained
enthusiasm have led him into paths on which he has wandered
lamentably astray. His works are indispensable, though very little of
his own conclusions can be believed.</p>

On most of the works like those of Prescott, Bancroft, Baldwin, and
others, I need not comment, having already expressed my opinion in
"Art of War and Mode of Warfare of the Ancient Mexicans," and
"Tenure and Distribution of Lands, and Customs with respect to Inheritance
among the Ancient Mexicans."&mdash;(10th and 11th Reports of the
Peabody Museum). In regard to Yucatecan paintings and carvings, I
have expressed my convictions in "Sources for aboriginal history of
Spanish America," Vol. 27 of the "Proceedings of the American Association
for advancement of Science." 1878.</p>

<p>I repeat it, this attempt at a bibliography on Yucatecan antiquities is
far from being complete,&mdash;many works of greater or less importance
having probably been overlooked.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center">CHIAPAS.</p>


<p>This district or State contains the well known ruins of Palenque and
Ocosingo. Still, but very few of the works hereafter mentioned relate
to these places. It is therefore a bibliography of Chiapas and of its
aborigines:&mdash;Zendal, Zoques, Zotzil, Chiapanecos, &amp;c., and not a
special bibliography of Palenque, &amp;c., which I intend to present,&mdash;convinced
that our lack of knowledge on the aborigines of Chiapas in general
is a chief cause of our ignorance about the past history of these
remains.</p>

<p>A large number of authors treating of Chiapas have already been
noticed in regard to Yucatan, and in such cases I merely give the
author's name, without the title or any other reference to his works,
except when there are special reasons for it.

In the 2d "<i>Recueil de piecés concernant le Méxique</i>," of Ternaux-Compans,

<p>There is, in fact, but very little published about the antiquities of
Chiapas, during the 16th century. I do not even mention any of the
general collections which have an occasional reference to the name. But
few vocabularies are noticed. Still we are informed of the following
works, which may yet be in existence, or which at all events have
existed once, and were written during the 16th century.

The library of the "Museo Nacional" of the City of Guatemala, contains
a number of fragments of a "<i>Historia de la Provincia de San
Vicente Ferrer de Chiapas y Guatemala</i>," the third book of which is superscribed:
"Isagoge histórico apologético general de todas las Indias."&mdash;There
is no date nor name of author, but it can be conjectured that it
was written in the 16th century.&mdash;Gregorio García also quotes: <i>Fray
Estévan de Salazar</i>. "Discurs. Symb. apost." who in turn is said to
refer to a book entitled "<i>Historia, i Relacion de la Teología de los Indios
Mexicanos</i>," said book being lost in a shipwreck, 1564.

<p>I make no mention of the compilations and general collections containing
references to Chiapas. They are not numerous.&mdash;Gregorio García
in his book, "Origen de los Indios," has probably the earliest mention
of the ruins of Ocosingo, and even perhaps, some indication about
those of Palenque.&mdash;Cortez who, accompanied by Bernal Diez, passed
very near Palenque in 1525, did not take any notice of the pueblo,&mdash;which
at that time was certainly not inhabited.

Nov. 1784. (Archives of the royal Academy, at Madrid).&mdash;It is directed

have already referred to it under "Yucatan." Whether the plates
of the English edition are genuine, is yet doubtful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I must add here, that until about 1820, the state of Chiapas pertained,
not to Mexico, but to the captain-generalcy of Guatemala, and consequently
all the authorities treating of the latter country may be supposed
to contain information about Chiapas also.

of Copan. Herrera made extensive use of Palacio's writings, but he
omitted that part which referred to Copan because it was not confirmed
(at his time) by any other testimony. The first publication of Palacio
was by Ternaux-Compans, in 1840, "Recueil de Documents et mémoires

fluent, but not always reliable. A Spanish copy appeared in

&amp;c."&mdash;Finally. Dr. Alexander von Frantzius published a German translation
in 1873, under the heading of "San Salvador and Honduras im
Jahre, 1576,"&mdash;which is particularly valuable on account of the notes by
the translator, as well as by Dr. C. H. Berendt.&mdash;Palacio must have visited
Copan about 1576, and the fact is established through him that its
buildings were in ruins at the time of the Spanish conquest, that is
about 1530, and no distinct traditions of their origin left.</p>

<p>Passing over all general collections and geographical works, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
of the sixteenth century, I will mention:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Cartas de Indias.</span>" (See Yucatan.) and the miscellaneous collections
like <i>"Colección de Documentos inéditos para la Historia de España,"
begun by Navarrete</i>, Miguel Salvá, and Pedro Saing de Barada, in
1842, and still continued.</p>

<p>"<i>Colección de Documentos relativos al Descubrimiento, Conquista y Colonizacion
de las Posesiones Españolas en América y Oceanía.</i>" Commenced
in 1864, and still continued.</p>

<p>(These collections contain chiefly documents from the "Real Archivo
de Indias," and although they are of recent date, the papers are all from
the earlier times of Spanish conquest and settlement.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The library of the "Museo Nacional" at the City of Guatemala (la
Nueva), contains the following:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafael Arévalo.</span> "Libro de Actas del Ayuntamiento de la Ciudad

does, a statement of the conquest of Guatemala, written by a native in
his own language.</p>

<p>"Documentos antiguos de la casa de Ixcuinte-Nèhàib."</p>

<p>In addition to these, I must lay particular stress on the "territorial
titles" land grants, cessions, leases, or deeds to lands, still held in Guatemala,&mdash;or
to whatever (if anything) may be left of their records.&mdash;Such

of the Indians.

is hardly possible to avoid all allusions to such subjects in any work on

livre Sacré et les Mythes de l'Antiquité Américaine, avec les livres

</p><p>
Hardly any work of this century has created such a "mixed" sensation
of a serious nature, as this book.&mdash;It could be seen at a glance,
that no mystification was possible,&mdash;but there was a wide field open for
discussion on the point of origin, as far as the document itself, the
"Popol Vuh," was concerned.&mdash;Still the "sensation" has not resulted
in much active critical examination, and I think (If I may be permitted
to commit such a breach of modesty,) myself the only person
attempting a criticism of the "Popol Vuh" on the basis of documentary
evidence. Unfortunately, I was unable to prepare my annotations
in time for the publication of the 27th Volume of Proceedings of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in 1878.&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Thus only the text of "Sources for aboriginal history of Spanish
America," appeared without any documentary evidence attached.
</p><p>
One thing is evident, that the "Popol Vuh" was <i>written</i>. Now it is a
fact very easily proven, that the aborigines of Guatemala had no phonetic
alphabet whatever, consequently <i>that they did not write</i>.&mdash;Therefore
the "Popol Vuh" must have been composed, as an instrument in
writing, since the conquest; or after 1524.&mdash;This is developed utterly
independent of the fact that the document hints at two data (p. 343,)
indicating the time of its composition to have been after 1550, and prior
to 1600.&mdash;Therefore it was written in our letters, or perhaps with the
aid of the "five characters" invented by Fray Francisco de la Parra,
previous to 1560, to indicate sounds for which our alphabet had no
signs.&mdash;At all events, it was written in the native Quiché idiom, and
was only met with incidentally by Fray Francisco Ximenez at the town
of Chichicastenango, towards the close of the 17th century.&mdash;This
Dominican monk translated it into the Spanish language and incorporated
both text and translation in the first volume of his "Historia de
la provincia de predicadores, &amp;c."&mdash;according to Brasseur de Bourbourg's
really silly and irritatingly confused bibliography&mdash;(p. XIII., "Notice
Bibliographique.") Dr. Scherzer certainly deserves credit for having
published a Spanish text rendering approximatively the "Popol Vuh,"
in 1857, and there is no doubt but that it is as correct a rendering of the
original Quiché as the French translation of Brasseur de Bourbourg.
</p><p>
The filiation of the text being thus established as far back as 1550 to
1600, it remains to investigate the question: how much of it was
originally Indian;&mdash;if all of it or not? There is no doubt but that the
greater part of it is Indian songs, preserved for centuries, and Indian
myths and tales&mdash;historical traditions&mdash;which were recorded by the compiler
in the form now before us. But this compiler, or rather&mdash;recorder&mdash;has
given to these tales a chronological sequence,&mdash;at least in the first
part,&mdash;which may hereafter prove conjectural.&mdash;Actions are made to succeed
to each other, which may yet prove to be without any connection
at all.&mdash;I do not insist upon this point&mdash;since a new translation of the
"Popol Vuh" should precede its investigation&mdash;but I particularly
insist upon a careful and critical study of its first so-called "Chapters."
</p><p>
These first chapters give us cosmological Ideas and Notions, purporting
to be originally Indian, which, at their very inception, show a singular
admixture of foreign elements. The first sentences appear to be transcriptions
from the book of Genesis. They are not aboriginally American.&mdash;We
are therefore led to investigate whether, prior to 1550, European
influences could have been brought to bear upon the recollection and
the imagination of the natives.&mdash;There is very positive evidence to that
effect.&mdash;The monks, at the earliest stages of conversion, used paintings
of their own, to impress upon the natives the notions of a creation of
the world, of the deluge and salvation of a single pair therefrom, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&mdash;The Dominican Father Gonzalo Lucero travelled about with
painted charts representing such striking events, which he displayed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
confirmation of his teachings. Fray Jacobo Testera (he died Aug. 8, 1543)
used similar means. Fray Pedro de Angulo, who went with Las Casas
to Guatemala and was made Provincial of Chiapas in 1561, wrote three
dissertations in the Zutuhil language, one on the Creation of the World,
one on Adam's Fall, and one on the Expulsion of our first fathers from
Paradise.&mdash;Fray Luis Cancer wrote similar pages in the language of
Oajaca, previous to 1546.&mdash;Fray Domingo Vico, who was killed by the
Indians of Lacandon, in 1555, wrote his "Teologia para los Indios," in
the Quiché language, also a dissertation on the "Eternal Paradise," in
the language of Vera-Paz.&mdash;But there is also indisputable proof that
<i>songs were composed on the subject of the creation of the world</i> and other
parts of the Hebrew Genesis, in the Quiché language, which songs
were used as the means of conversion of the natives of Vera-Paz in
1537. (Remesal. Lib. III., Cap. XI., p. 124.) They had been composed
by Las Casas, Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada, Fray Pedro de Angulo, and
probably Fray Luis Cancer. Many other similar ones were composed
afterwards.
</p><p>
Thus we see that, prior to 1550, ecclesiastics had commenced to write
upon cosmological subjects with our letters and in the languages of
Guatemala, and that, on the other hand, Christian cosmogony had
become a text for Indian songs. The "Popol Vuh" has therefore nothing
extraordinary in its origin; it is but a child of its time, like the
"Memorial de Tecpan-Atitlan," by the Chief of Sololá, only anonymous,&mdash;and
preceded by a cosmological introduction made up of Christian
and Indian tales confusedly intermingled, and therefore apocryphal so
far. These criticisms, however, apply merely to the "first part,"&mdash;the
rest of the "Popol Vuh" appears to be original, and therefore of the
greatest value. This however cannot be said of the translation, only of
the MS. A new translation, supervised by a native, should be obtained
at any price.

"Grammaire Quichée, et le Drame Rabinal-Aché." Paris, 1862.
</p><p>
Of the "Rabinal-Aché," a new translation is absolutely requisite.
Mr. Brasseur, like all translators of Indian songs, has so disfigured it
by the introduction of a foreign terminology, as to render it useless for
any one who has no access to vocabularies, &amp;c.

In closing this list, I must again distinctly state, that it is very imperfect,&mdash;and
that no one acquainted with the literature of Central America
can fail to notice many omissions.&mdash;But I had neither time, nor opportunity
to do better, owing to the state of my health. In conclusion, I
wish to advert to a few books of an exclusively bibliographical tenor,
which every student of American history must at least attempt to consult.&mdash;Some
of them are, unfortunately, extremely rare:
</p><p>

<span class="smcap">J. Mariano Bèristain de Souza.</span> "Biblioteca Hispana Americana.
Septentrional." México, 1816 and 1819, 3 volumes. (Exceedingly rare.)

<span class="smcap">Brasseur de Bourbourg.</span> "Bibliothéque méxico-guatemalienne."
Paris, 1871.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I forbear quoting here at length the bibliographical works of Harrisse,
Rich, Ludewig, Ternaux-Compans, Sabin, and others.&mdash;They are
deservedly well known, and of easy access to any student.

is probably the earliest mention of the ruins of Mitla, which were, however,
inhabited at that time. Motolinia has been entirely overlooked by
Bancroft, although his description of Mitla is truly excellent.

of it printed, at Mexico, 1867, by S<sup>r</sup> José F<sup>r</sup> Ramirez.)&mdash;Very important;
mentions again Mitla as a settlement inhabited about 1450. "Apéndice"

casual mention of Oajaca.

I forbear mentioning here <i>all</i> the writers on Oajaca,&mdash;more particularly
avoiding all the general works,&mdash;those excepted which contain
plates of special value. The first who called attention to Mitla was
certainly
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Alexander von Humboldt.</span> "Vues des Cordilléres et monuments
des peuples indigénes de l'Amérique." Paris, 1810. Royal folio.&mdash;Same,
2 vols. 8<sup>o</sup> Paris, 1816. English version, by Helen M. Williams, London,

also in Lord Kingsborough's "Antiquities of Mexico.")
</p><p><br /></p><p>

Contributions. No. 86, Washington, 1856.) Contains Sawkins' drawings
of Mitla.

</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Juan B. Carriedo.</span> The writings of this author are, unfortunately,
but little known.&mdash;In the "Ilustracion Mexicana," Vol. II., he has given
an essay on "Los Palacios Antiguos de Mitla."&mdash;But he has published
other papers and even books on the same subject.
</p><p>
"Estudios históricos, y estadísticos del estado Oaxaqueño." Oajaca,
1850.
</p><p>
The Astor Library of New York has an incomplete copy of a work of
Carriedo on Oajaca, with colored drawings by him,&mdash;unfinished. Copious
notes by the author's own hand accompany the text. In historical
questions Carriedo mostly follows and cites Burgoa.
</p><p><br /></p><p>
<span class="smcap">Francisco Pimentel.</span> "Cuadro descriptivó de las Lenguas Indígenas
de México." (See Yucatan and Chiapas.)
</p><p><br /></p><p>
<span class="smcap">Manuel Orozco y Berra.</span> In "Geografia de las Lenguas."&mdash;Reference
is made to a number of very important papers on Oajaca, the title
of one, among others, "Estado que comprende el número de Parroquias
de la Diócesis de Oajaca, con expresion de sus nombres, Estado ó
Territorio en que están situadas, número de pueblos, &amp;c., &amp;c."
</p><p>
Further, certain official reports are quoted,&mdash;the originals of which are
in the hands of my friend S<sup>r</sup> J. G. Icazbalceta,&mdash;S<sup>r</sup> Orozco mentions the
following:
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Pedro de Ledesma.</span> "Relacion de Oajaca, por el alcalde...." 1579.
</p><p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
</p><p>
Finally, I must call attention to a linguistical work, known to me
only through S<sup>r</sup> Orozco y Berra's citation, and through references given
by S<sup>r</sup> Pimentel&mdash;to wit:
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Antonio de Los Reyes.</span> "Arte en lengua mixteca." México, 1593.
</p><p>
Numerous grammars, vocabularies, "doctrinas," sermonaries, &amp;c.,
&amp;amp;amp;c., were written in the course of the 16th century, of and in the language
of Oajaca.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In conclusion, I would merely beg to add,&mdash;that there can hardly be
any doubt as to the fact that Mitla was <i>inhabited</i> when the Spaniards
first visited the place. It therefore becomes a point of special interest.</p>

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
